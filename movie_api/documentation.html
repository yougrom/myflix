        <p>The MyFlix API is a API that makes it easy to find the data you need, provides a
            simplified data structure via JSON payload, and reduces the number of calls to a single
            URL. The MyFlix API provides an industry standard solution to receive real-time access to premier MyFlix
            title and name entertainment datasets.
