        <h1>API Product Overview</h1>
        <p>The MyFlix API is a API that makes it easy to find the data you need, provides a
            simplified data structure via JSON payload, and reduces the number of calls to a single
            URL. The MyFlix API provides an industry standard solution to receive real-time access to premier MyFlix
            title and name entertainment datasets.
        </p>
        <p>
            The API you create will need to be able to interact with and respond to data requests about movies or users,
            returning the requested data to the client (which, in this case, is the “myFlix” app). These requests will
            be handled by a server-side web framework.
